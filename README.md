# FlashChat_iOS


FlashChat app inspired from the Udemy Course by Angela Yu. This is a messaging app where users can send messages into a group chat and anyone who has an account will see all other messages sent. This app uses Firebase for authentication of user for registering and logging in, and Firestore as the database to store messages that the user sends. I also used Cocoapods to incorporate 3rd party libraries such as CLTypingLabel to animate the logo when the app is loading. For the sequeu management between view controllers I used Navigation Controller and Bar Buttons. This app also used Tableview and custom nib cells on the tableview.
